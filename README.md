# Forecasting-compoent-failure-using-Ant-colony-optimization-for-predictive-maintenance
This project is about to find the component failure before it happens in the future. Therefore, a new approach is applied optimization algorithm called Ant colony optimization. This is a preliminary step for this project and still improving on it.
